# Stock-Analysis Using Excel and VBA
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to refactor our previously created code, making it more efficient. Using this refactored code, we would take stock data and interpret the results of their performance in 2017 and 2018.
## Results
### Stock Analysis

Looking at the images side-by-side, we can see that many of these stocks have dropped from 2017 to 2018. The only ones who stayed positive were ENPH and RUN. Also, TERP, while still remaining negative, slightly improved.

Using the refactored code shown above, the efficiency of the code improved drastically. The run-time was decreased by about 0.55 seconds. The previous code would run at about 0.8 seconds, but this new runs at around 0.25. The screenshots below show the results. These photos are also in the resources folder.

## Summary
### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactored Code
Some advantages of refactoring code can include making it cleaner and easier to read. This especially comes in handy when we want to show it to someone who is, for example, being introduced into the project. This also comes in handy when the user hasn't look at the code for a while and when they come back, it is easier for them to get their bearings. Another advantage includes faster programming, with good code, the computer will take less time to run it. One of the biggest disadvantages that come from refactoring code is the possibility of creating new bugs and errors, ruining the original code. This is why it is important to create a copy of your code if you plan on making drastic changes.
### Pros and Cons of Refactored VBA Script
As we saw from the screenshots above, one of the biggest advantages of this refactored code is that it takes less time to run. The new refactored code also had one subroutine. This way everything would run all at once. There does not seem to be any disadvantage from the new code, there is always the possibility of running into new errors and bugs, but this has all been dealt with.
